									<p>Maharaja (2024) is an intense action thriller directed by Nithilan Swaminathan, starring Vijay Sethupathi in his 50th film. The story follows a barber named Maharaja, who reports a burglary to the police, cryptically stating that his "Lakshmi" has been taken. This initially creates confusion, but as the investigation unfolds, the true nature of the theft—and its deeper implications—gradually come to light.

										The film employs a non-linear narrative, switching between past and present to build suspense. It explores themes of justice, vengeance, and moral dilemmas, with strong performances, especially from Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap, who plays a chilling antagonist. The cinematography and intense action sequences further enhance the gripping storytelling​
										.
										
										Maharaja is available for streaming on Netflix.</p>

                                <p>I Saw the Devil (Korean: 악마를 보았다) is a 2010 South Korean action-thriller film directed by Kim Jee-woon and written by Park Hoon-jung. Starring Lee Byung-hun and Choi Min-sik, the film follows NIS agent Kim Soo-hyun (Lee), who embarks on a quest for vengeance when his fiancée gets brutally murdered by psychopathic serial killer Jang Kyung-chul (Choi).

                                    I Saw the Devil marks Choi Min-sik's first major role since the changes to the Korean screen quota system. The film premiered in the United States at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and had a limited U.S. theatrical release, where it received generally favourable reviews from critics.</p>

									<p>Shutter Island is the type of film where the majority of conversation around it revolves around its masterful final act twist, one that completely recontextualizes the entire film and places it in a new light. Even outside this iconic twist, Shutter Island's ability to keep the audience on edge and second-guessing themselves up until the moment the twist is revealed is what makes it such a compelling and rewatchable thriller. Scorsese is a master of tension and character building, with Shutter Island being the type of story that allows him to fully explore the horrors and limitless possibilities of psychosis.</p>

        <p>Oldboy, the director's most infamous film, helped establish Park Chan-wook's reputation for creating disturbing movies with unexpected twists and turns. Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), the protagonist of the neo-noir action film, has just been released from jail when he discovers that he is enmeshed in an extensive plot that is being manipulated by unknown influences.

            It is in viewers' best interest to walk into this film with as little prior information as possible about the complicated and provocative events that have contributed to the film's notoriety. Oldboy offers viewers the opportunity to experience a seamless integration of heart-wrenching drama paired with flawlessly choreographed action sequences, all of which contribute to the film's status as an engrossing one that no remake will ever be able to replicate. </p>

        <p>In the neo-noir psychological thriller film Memento, the main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), is a man who lives with anterograde amnesia, which means he is unable to form new memories. The former insurance investigator goes on a complicated journey after being brutally assaulted by two assailants who also took his wife's life, which is what prompted him to go on a mission to exact revenge.

            The unconventional narrative of Christopher Nolan's mind-bending film is presented in a non-linear form, and the film's two seemingly unrelated tales are meant to symbolize the protagonist's fractured point of view. As Leonard stitches together evidence via his method, which involves the use of Polaroid images and tattoos, since it is the only way for him to recall what he discovers about the assailant, they ultimately start to make more sense.</p>

        <p>Director Christopher Nolan's final entry in his legendary superhero trilogy and also one of the top thriller movies ever, The Dark Knight Rises depicts the end of Batman's (Christian Bale) years of exile. Clearly affected by his perceived role in Harvey Dent's (Aaron Eckhart) fate, Batman is coaxed out of hiding by a potential new ally and a new villain who intends to ruin Gotham, Bane (Tom Hardy).

            While it didn't reach the same heights that The Dark Knight did, the 2012 film did a fantastic job of ending the renowned trilogy with its exhilarating story. Bane continues to be an unforgettable antagonist who's still referenced in pop culture today, while Batman is a character that enjoys its enduring reputation as one of the greatest anti-heroes to ever make it from the comic books to the big screen.</p>

            <p>Based on the eponymous 1995 novel by Christopher Priest, The Prestige follows the rivalry between two stage magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Directed by Christopher Nolan, the movie is set at the end of the 19th century, when the two protagonists find themselves competing in increasingly risky ways. In their attempts to outdo each other, they begin to become legitimate threats to themselves and those around them.

                The psychological thriller by Nolan delves into the deadly contest the two magicians engage in as they strive for bigger, bolder, and wilder acts. With no other priority than to come out on top, viewers will be both eager and afraid to see where their obsession takes them, which includes some unlikely real-life historical figures (and perhaps to one of the most iconic movie twists ever). </p>

									<p>The Silence of the Lambs is a genre-defining film that needs no introduction. The psychological horror film follows the young FBI trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who consults an imprisoned Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who she believes can provide insight into catching the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). Their conversations become cryptic back-and-forth interactions which soon become frustrating for Clarice, who's also just trying to prove her worth as a woman in the male-dominated industry.

                                        Directed by Jonathan Demme, the classic film is synonymous with its creepy yet highly intelligent villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is a cannibal and a psychiatrist. The conversations between him and Clarice are spine-chilling, which influence the kind of hair-raising twists and turns towards the end of the movie. It has held up well and is considered one of the most important works in cinematic history.

									<p>Inception is a mind-blowing sci-fi film focusing on a group of “extractors” led by Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), a professional thief who can infiltrate the subconscious to steal information. They’re sent on an unprecedented mission to implant an idea in a target’s subconscious, and Cobb assembles a talented team of thieves and specialists to help him carry it out. Soon, Cobb’s messy past and an expensive defense system soon complicate their journey.

                                        Directed by Christopher Nolan, the renowned mind-boggling film uses stunning visuals to deliver its wonderfully complex story. It’s a thriller unlike any other, as the stakes continue to get higher the deeper the extractors get into the subconscious. Alongside career-best performances from the cast, Inception soars thanks to meticulously crafted set pieces and flawless action sequences that make use of these to build an effective action sci-fi thriller. </p>
